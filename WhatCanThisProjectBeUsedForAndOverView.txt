Using RandomUser.me api this project gets registered users and allows the User to filter through them

It uses Flexbox, CSS transitions and JavaScript, asynch await and fetch 

This could be converted to be used in (for example) the following ways

- API practice 
- Cool little side project 


NOTE: Filter function is not working  :-( 
    cannot search through users. 

    Issue with API initiailly and not sure if filter issue is a subset of that but need to move on.
